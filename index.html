    <h1>The coffee trend from America causing a froth</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>It's the first week of autumn and that's heralded the return of an unusual offering to our coffee shops. So what is it?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Pumpkin spice lattes have become a seasonal trend in Belfast at this time of the year. Coffee experts trace its origins to the influence of America, social media and Halloween, when traditionally pumpkins are carved. If you are not aware of the seasonal
      coffee, it's a latte with an extra flavors, but instead of your usual flavors like caramel or vanilla, this one has a hint of cinnamon and nutmeg. Starbucks started developing the Pumpkin Spice Latte in January 2003 following the successful introduction
      of winter seasonal drinks such as the Peppermint Mocha and Eggnog Latte. According to Peter Dukes, Starbucks' director of Espresso Americas, developers tested ten products with consumers, with the Pumpkin Spice Latte coming out in the middle of
      the group after chocolate and caramel flavors. Dukes said that "developers realized there was something special around the pumpkin flavor, especially since there wasn't anything around pumpkin at the time". The company experimented with different
      combinations and ratios of pumpkin to spice, ultimately deciding on a recipe with no pumpkin in it. In fall of 2003, the final recipe was tested in Vancouver and Washington, D.C. Sales of the drink exceeded the company's expectations: Dukes said
      "we couldn't keep up initially... We had to expedite inventory to the stores." The product went on sale in all U.S. Starbucks stores the following year. The company said that Pumpkin Spice Latte was Starbucks' most popular seasonal beverage, with
      more than 200 million sold between its 2003 introduction and 2015. The beverage started a trend of pumpkin spice products, such as candles and air fresheners, as well as for foods as diverse as donuts, breakfast cereals, cough drops, and pasta sauce.
      In August 2015, Starbucks changed the recipe to include pumpkin and remove artificial colors. The ingredients announced included a "pumpkin pie flavored syrup" made with sugar, condensed skim milk, pumpkin puree, coloring and preservative.

    <h2>Love you a latte</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Around the 1930s, a ready-made 'pumpkin pie spice' blend was being advertised for sale in American newspapers by well-known brands. Fast-forward to 2003, when Starbucks launched their pumpkin spice latte - frequently credited with having kick-started
      the flavor combo's exponential rise to fame. According to their website, the coffee chain wanted to create a seasonal drink that screamed 'autumn', to be sold in the gap between their other seasonal products. Their research and development team
      started working on it in spring, so they had to bring the fall to their offices using decorations and pumpkin pies. Slices of the dessert were followed by shots of espresso, and that's when the light bulbs came on and the latte was born. The drink
      sent the world crazy for pumpkin spice: pumpkin spice has been used over 2 million times on Instagram to tag pictures of all things autumn - from cozy living rooms lit by candles to home baking featuring the spice mix. There are many different theories
      behind this success story: a sense of nostalgia; its limited, seasonal availability; even the comfort of a sweet and spicy treat when times are tough. But whatever the reason, this simple combination of spices is a reminder of the incredible story
      behind some of the ingredients we can easily access today.</p>

    <h2>What Is Latte Art? Is it's a coffee that looks too good to drink?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>It goes by many names: coffee art, barista art and coffee designs. But what is latte art? The short answer - it's steamed milk passed through espresso in order to make patterns.But the long answer is much more interesting as latte art is the only
      drink in which creativity can be consumed. Literally. How else can you drink a heart, tulip or a dragon if not on coffee art? It would be difficult to say the least, and definitely not as tasty! Ever since the 1980s when latte art first took to
      popularity in the coffee houses and cafes around the world, only the upper echelon of baristas could produce coffee art in their drinks. But how did they make it? It all began with two things, the espresso shot and perfectly steamed milk. As coffee
      making technology improved with the introduction of pistol driven espresso machines, baristas learned how to incorporate steamed milk into the traditional Italian espresso. This fusion of flavors allowed for a sweeter beverage but also for the production
      of 'micro foamed milk', which is the end result of milk exposed to high-powered steam. Baristas soon learned through a process of accidental discovery that patterns could be made in coffees with this new technique. The espresso could act as a canvas
      to the barista while the milk took the role of paint. These techniques improved as time pasted and today modern baristas are judged on their latte art making abilities. There are now two main forms coffee art, 'free pour art' and 'etching'.</p>

      <h2>Latte art</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Latte art is a method of preparing coffee created by pouring micro foam into a shot of espresso and resulting in a pattern or design on the surface of the latte. It can also be created or embellished by simply "drawing" in the top layer of foam.
        Latte art is particularly difficult to create consistently, due to the demanding conditions required of both the espresso shot and milk. This, in turn, is limited by the experience of the barista and quality of the espresso machine. The pour itself,
        then, becomes the last challenge for the latte artist. The term is not reserved to latte coffee only, it also applies for other beverages containing milk foam like cappuccino and hot chocolate.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Chemistry</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Latte art is a mixture of two colloids: the crema, which is an emulsion of coffee oil and brewed coffee; and the micro foam, which is a foam of air in milk. Milk itself is an emulsion of butterfat in water, while coffee is a mixture of coffee solids
        in water. Neither of these colloids are stable - crema dissipates from espresso, while micro foam separates into drier foam and liquid milk - both degrading significantly in a matter of seconds, and thus latte art lasts only briefly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='boxText'>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Latte art developed independently in different countries, following the introduction of espresso and the development of micro foam, the combination of crema (which is an emulsion of coffee oil and brewed coffee) and micro foam allowing the pattern;
        it presumably was initially developed in Italy. In the United States, latte art was developed in Seattle in the 1980s and 1990s, and particularly popularized by David Schomer. Schomer credits the development of micro foam ("velvet foam" or "milk
        texturing") to Jack Kelly of Uptown espresso in 1986, and by 1989 the heart pattern was established and a signature at Schomer's Espresso Vivace. The rosette pattern was then developed by Schomer in 1992, recreating the technique based on a photograph
        he saw from Cafe Mateki in Italy. Schomer subsequently popularized latte art in his course "Caffe Latte Art". At the same time Luigi Lupi from Italy met Schomer on the internet and they exchanged videos they made on Latte art and Cappuccini Decorati.
        Luigi Lupi involved and growth up this art and invented the Tulip in Salonnico during an Exhibition in the MUSETTI booth (2004).</p>
    </div>

    <div class='boxText'>
      <h2>Technique</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Latte art requires first producing espresso with crema and microfoam, and then combining these to make latte art. See microfoam: procedure for how microfoam is made; this article concentrates on the latte art once the foam is made. Before the milk
        is added, the espresso shot must have a creamy brown surface, an emulsion known as crema. As the white foam from the milk rises to meet the red/brown surface of the shot,a contrast is created and the design emerges. As the milk is poured, the
        foam separates from the liquid and rises to the top. If the milk and espresso shot are "just right", and the pitcher is moved during the pour, the foam will rise to create a pattern on the surface. Alternatively, a pattern may be etched with a
        stick after the milk has been poured, rather than during the pour. Some controversy exists within the coffee community as to whether or not there is excessive focus on latte art amongst baristas. The argument is that too much focus on the superficial
        appearance of a drink leads some to ignore more important issues, such as taste. This is especially relevant with new baristas.</p>
    </div>

    <div class='boxText box_3'>
      <h2>Styles</h2>
      <br>
      <p>There are two main types of latte art: free pouring (pattern created during the pour) and etching (using a tool to create a pattern after the pour). Free pouring is far more common in American cafés, and requires little additional time in preparing
        a drink.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Free pouring</h2>
      <br>
      <p>The two most common forms of poured latte art are a heart shape and the "rosetta" or "rosette", also known as "fern" which resembles a type of flower or fern. Of these,hearts are simpler and more common in macchiatos, while rosettes are more complex
        and more common in lattes. For free pouring, the cup is either kept level or tilted in one direction. As the milk is poured straight into the cup, the foam begins to surface on one side (due to the tilt). The barista then moves the pitcher from
        side to side as they level the cup, or simply wiggle the spout back and forth, and finishes by making a quick strike through the previously poured pattern. This "strike" creates the stem portion of the flower design, and bends the poured zig-zag
        into a flower shape. A more direct pour and less wiggling yields a heart shape, and minor variation (reduced lobes, larger stem) yields an apple shape. More complex patterns are possible, some requiring multiple pours. Some examples of advanced
        latte art techniques are that of the tulip, wave heart, swan, or even a scorpion.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Etching</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Etched patterns range from simple geometric shapes to complicated drawings, such as crosshatching, images of animals and flowers, and are generally performed with a coffee stirrer of some sort. Etched latte art typically has a shorter lifespan than
        free poured latte art as the foam dissolves into the latte more quickly. A crude but quick method with cappuccino is to pour chocolate powder through a metal cutout in which an image, typically a flower, has been incised. This is favoured by chain
        coffee shops like Costa where speed is of the essence when serving large numbers of clients during peak times.</p>
